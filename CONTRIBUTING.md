# Contributing

Found a bug, typo, missing feature or a description that doesn't make sense or needs improving? Great, please let us know!

⚠️ Due to the nature of API specifications and their dependencies in our software, we can't accept every pull request
from the community before reaching out to us and coordinating changes to the APIs.  
Submitting pull requests for typos, formatting issues etc. are happily accepted. For other things, please talk to us first!

### Bug Reports :bug:

- If you find a bug, please search for it first in the [Issues](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues), 
  and if it isn't already tracked, [create a new issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues/new).  
- Issues that have already been identified as a bug will be labelled `bug`.

### New Features :bulb:

If you'd like to add new functionality to an API, describe the problem you want to solve in a
[new Issue](https://github.com/unfoldedcircle/core-api/issues/new).
