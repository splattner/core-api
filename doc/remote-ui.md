# Remote Two User Interface

The user interface was designed to be easy to use by anyone, who can use a smart home app. Similar principles were
applied to the touch interface, enhanced with button navigation and control.

## Profiles

A profile can contain customised settings and UI configurations, including pages, groups and entities.

A profile can be changed by tapping on the current profile in settings.

## Pages

![Overview](img/pages.jpg)

A page can contain entities or groups. Pages can be selected by swiping left and right or using the left and right
buttons on the D-pad. Tapping the page's name will bring up the page selector, where pages can be also added, deleted or
renamed. Pages can have an image header and contain entities or groups. Multiple pages can contain the same entity.

A page can be used to segment rooms, areas, a specific purpose or anything else that makes sense to you.

## Groups

Groups are a set of entities that can be defined by the user. Groups are another way of organising entities. A group can
be configured to have a group switch, that can turn on/off every entity within the group at once. A group can be
collapsed or expanded.
